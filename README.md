# DC Scheduler

This repository hosts custom Crestron scheduler files for The Chicago School, Washington DC campus.  

## Files
- **index.html** — Main layout file for the scheduler display  
- **style.css** — Custom CSS to override default Crestron styling (background, logo placement, etc.)  
- **logo.png** — The Chicago School logo used for branding  

## Usage
These files are published using **GitHub Pages** and linked to Crestron Room Schedulers through the “Theme / Style Override” setting.  

## Notes
- Any updates made to `style.css` or `index.html` will automatically update on the scheduler once committed to the main branch.  
- Keep the logo filename consistent (`logo.png`) to avoid broken links.  
- For future campuses, duplicate this repository and update the campus-specific details.
